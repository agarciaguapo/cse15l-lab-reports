# Introduction #
One of the most important aspects in programming is to be able to work wherever you can no matter where you are. You are probably wondering how this can be done \
since this sounds like it can be really difficult however, this is really simple. The key to be able to do such thing is thorugh remote servers. They can be easily \ 
accessed and in this lab report I will be going over the steps on how you can connect to a remote server using an code editor called VS Code. By the end of the lab \
you should be able to remotley connect to a server using a ieng6 account thorugh VS Code.\

# Installing VS Code
Before we try to connecting to a server we need to install VS Code as this will be the code editor we will be using to access the server. In my case I didn't have \
to install VS Code as I had already installed since it was required for CSE 11 last quarter at UCSD. However, if you don't have VS Code install yet yoy can easily \ 
find it by going to this [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
